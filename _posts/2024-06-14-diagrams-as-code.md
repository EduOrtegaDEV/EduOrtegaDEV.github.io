Hey Edu from the future!, do you remember that time when you had to use Enterprise Architect to create an UML diagram?, and if you want to modify something you had to open the file again (First lookup where the file is) and mofify it?. Well those days are far from now that everything is online.

Diagram as Code (DAC) refers to the practice of creating and managing visual diagrams using textual descriptions rather than graphical interfaces. This approach allows engineers, developers, and system architects to define infrastructure, architecture, workflows, or any other visual representation using code.

One of the main benefits is that diagrams are part of the repository (The diagram itself is code) and everyone in the team can modify them on the fly. my favorite tool is PlantUML/PlantText.

Here you can find a beautiful template for creating Realtional Diagrams for Databases for [PlantUML](https://gist.github.com/EduOrtegaDEV/920734c2e80716b45889d5f0fe5cb2e4).

Until next time, Edu from the past.

Happy coding!

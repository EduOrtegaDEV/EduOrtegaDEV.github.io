Hey Edu!.

Do you remember that time when you had to use Enterprise Architect to create an UML diagram?, and if you want to modify something you had to open the file again (First lookup where the file is) and mofify it?. Well those days are far from now that everything is online.

So Diagram as Code is the same thing as Infrastructure as Code, the diagrams are part of the repository (The diagram itself is code) and everyone in the team can modify them on the fly. my favorite tool is PlantUML/PlantText.

Here you can find a beautiful template for [PlantUML](https://gist.github.com/EduOrtegaDEV/920734c2e80716b45889d5f0fe5cb2e4).

Happy coding!

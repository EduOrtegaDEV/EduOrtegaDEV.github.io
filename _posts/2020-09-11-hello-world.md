Welcome to my new blog!, few months ago I decided to delete my Wordpress blog because it demanded too much time to configure and mantain, now I'm using GitHub as my "hosting". If you are wondering how is this possible I would recommend you to take a look at this [post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) in which you can set up your blog. It's not difficult at all and the most tedious part was configuring my domain, but is easy overall. Hope you'll find this information useful as I did.

Happy coding!

# Long live embedded databases

## Introduction
Hey there, Edu from the future! As you embark on your programming journey, you'll encounter various types of projects that require efficient data storage solutions. Not all projects necessitate a complex database with elaborate drivers and client-server functionality. In fact, many small to mid-sized projects can thrive with a small, lightweight database that's integrated directly into the application. One excellent example of this is mobile apps that don't require API integration. An embedded database is the perfect fit, providing a seamless and hassle-free experience.

## What is an Embedded Database?
An embedded database is a database management system (DBMS) that's integrated directly into an application's software stack, rather than being accessed through a separate server process. In other words, the database engine runs within the same process space as the application itself. This design allows for faster data access, reduced latency, and improved overall performance.

**Popular Options**
When it comes to choosing an embedded database, you're spoiled for choice. Some popular options include:
1. **[Firebird](https://www.firebirdsql.org/)**: A powerful and open-source relational database that's widely used in various industries.
2. **DBF**: A file-based database that's simple to use and ideal for small projects.3.
3. **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)**: A lightweight, self-contained database that's perfect for mobile and web applications.
4. **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)**: A columnar database that's designed for fast querying and data analysis.

One important feature is that most of the options have a high compatibility with standard SQL. 


## Why Choose an Embedded Database?
Embedded databases offer several advantages over traditional client-server databases:
1. **Lightweight Nature**: Embedded databases are designed to be compact and efficient, making them ideal for resource-constrained devices.
2. **Ease of Integration**: Embedded databases are integrated directly into the application, reducing the complexity of database setup and configuration.
3. **Low Overhead**: Embedded databases don't require a separate server process, which reduces the overhead and improves overall system performance.
4. **Offline Access**: Embedded databases allow for offline access, making them perfect for applications that require data storage and retrieval even when the device is offline.

## Drawbacks
While embedded databases offer many benefits, they're not without their limitations. Some potential drawbacks to consider include:
1. **Limited Scalability**: Embedded databases are designed for small to mid-sized projects and may not be suitable for large-scale applications.
2. **Limited Features**: Embedded databases may not offer the same level of features and functionality as traditional client-server databases.

## Conclusion
As you embark on your programming journey, it's essential to consider the advantages and disadvantages of embedded databases. For studying and tutorial purposes, you can experiment with any of the options mentioned above. The best part is that all of these options can be used with DBeaver, a powerful and popular database tool that's widely used in the industry.

Happy coding!

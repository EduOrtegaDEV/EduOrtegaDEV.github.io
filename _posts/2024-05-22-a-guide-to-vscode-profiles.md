Hey future Edu,

I want to take a moment to reflect on one of the most powerful features in VSCode that has greatly improved my productivity: VSCode Profiles.

## What are VSCode Profiles?
VSCode Profiles allow you to create and manage multiple sets of settings, extensions, and UI customizations within a single VSCode installation. This feature is particularly useful for developers who work on different projects or have different workflows that require distinct configurations.

Imagine you're working on a project that requires a specific set of extensions, such as a React project that needs the ESLint extension for code linting. With VSCode Profiles, you can create a profile specifically for this project, installing only the necessary extensions and configuring the settings to match your project's requirements. This way, when you switch to a different project, you can easily switch to a different profile that's tailored to that project's needs.

## How to Create and Manage VSCode Profiles
Creating a new profile in VSCode is straightforward. You can do this by going to the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS), typing "Profiles: Create Profile," and following the prompts. Once you've created a new profile, you can switch between profiles by going to the Command Palette and typing "Profiles: Switch Profile." or simply by click in the gear icon in the bottom-left corner and then selecting profiles.

Here are my current profiles for [JS](https://gist.github.com/eduortega85/b0f40ec70b0fb8605676392999c1978e) and [C#](https://gist.github.com/eduortega85/bdaaec8b4da3e8cee85d27d5fd35dee4).

Happy coding!
